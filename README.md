# DocThunder

DocThunder is a doxygen replacement for C code projects.
DocThunder is based heavily on docurium from github, but attempts to separate
the parsing and output stages completely.

This allows DocThunder to easily target multiple output formats using a simple
template system.

Of course we shall be providing the original docurium like template!

## Future Project Type Support

We are aiming to support the following other project types and languages:
   
   * C++
   * VHDL - Describe register layouts, and produce headers files.
